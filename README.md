# iPhoneForensics
Using open source Autopsy software (Basis Technology) suite dug into an imaged iPhone and discovered evidence.

Digging into an imaged iPhone to paticipate in the discovery process of examining text messages, emails, iPhone Camera images, and GPS location data was by far one of the most rewarding assignments. It was equally enjoyable to leverage my previous experience as a paralegal to properly lay out causes of action in a conspiracy timeline. What was additionally enjoyble was some of the email attachments were encrypted requiring additional research to decrypt. As a result, I learnt how to decode base 64 encoded strings and get the resulting audio, and learned how to use fcrackzip, a Kali utility that unlocks encrypted .zip files.  

The report document has a table of contents that is easy enough to navigate through however, to summarize: It contains a brief outline of the conspiracy cause of action, details of the iphone, followed by evidence that fits the cause of action, how the evidence relates in a general timeline, and, GPS data plotted on a map.
